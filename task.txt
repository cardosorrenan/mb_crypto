Develop an API that returns the price of a specific currency when querying the endpoint 
with the currency symbol, such as BTC. The project code should include a Makefile to execute 
the API with the "make api" command. The endpoint, accessed through a POST request to 
"localhost/api/coin_infos," should receive a payload with the currency symbol, like "BTC" and 
return the currency name, symbol, price in Brazilian Reais, price in US dollars, and the date 
and time of the request. Optionally, the project may include a docker-compose.yml file to set up 
a local cache with Redis, with a 3-minute expiration.
